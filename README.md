# Hi! What's up? ðŸ˜„

### I'm Lara. I'm 27 years old and I live in Vila Velha - ES, Brasil. I'm currently working at willbank, as a Quality Assistant. I work with gamification, motivation and engagement campaings. I'm taking classes at Udemy, to learn web design. I studied Advertising and Marketing for 2 years and then switched to Journalism. I speak Portuguese, English and a little bit of Spanish. I always liked learning design, so, this is my goal for the future! See ya! âš¡
